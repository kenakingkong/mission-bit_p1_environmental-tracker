Mission Bit Intro to Python Spring 2026 Project 1 Sample

### Environmental Awareness Project
> Create a Python program to track personal environmental impact based on daily activities like showers taken and meals eaten.

The Environmental Tracker project involves creating a Python program to track personal environmental impact based on daily activities like showers taken and meals eaten. The project is divided into four parts, each introducing new data types (constants, strings, floats, tuples, arrays) and programming concepts (variables, input/output, operations).

**Part 1:** Create a simple Python program to track your personal environmental impact, specifically focusing on the number of showers you take and their water consumption.

**Part 2:** Refactor and improve your project with string variables for input prompts. Add a number of meals per week variable to our calculations. [[🔗 Spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS84B8NJAFGMSMBIY5MMp-BhE6Z-jabJE05QR-sMc5hJqZHRZavNdpNEYWvMnoFOCcdp_U4ZN_rH47j/pub)]

**Part 3:** Improve your project by using a template for input prompts and storing input prompt variables in a tuple. Add miles driven variable with a float datatype.

**Part 4:** Add an array to store each user input, then loop through the array programmatically using a for loop. [[🔗 Spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRYnyli_3ktXqiev2EmXOuKv-h_S8BDve_xpKolKzn2akYCQNJlZws2E1U57wrs41GoIH82T4JV1gBC/pub)]
